# K-Nearest-Neighbors-KNN-Classification
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification is a simple yet powerful supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification problems. It works on the idea that data points with similar features tend to belong to the same class. Instead of building an explicit model during training, KNN stores all the training data and makes predictions
